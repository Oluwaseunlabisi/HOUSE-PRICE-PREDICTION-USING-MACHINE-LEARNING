# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

Background
Lagos is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa, with a rapidly expanding population and a booming real estate market. The city's housing market is highly competitive, with a wide range of properties available at varying prices. However, with the high demand for housing, it can be challenging for buyers and sellers to accurately determine the fair market value of a property.

Objective
The objective of this case study is to help Cressida Homes, a new entrant into the Real Estate Market, develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house in Lagos based on its features, such as size, number of bedrooms, and amenities.

Data
The data used in this case study is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on various properties in Lagos, including their location, size, number of bedrooms, and price. The dataset contains over 545 records and 13 variables.

Methodology

The methodology used in this case study involves the following steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing: The first step is to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables as necessary.

Exploratory data analysis: Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, such as identifying trends and patterns, and identifying correlations between variables.

Feature engineering: Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, we will perform feature engineering to select the most relevant features for predicting house prices and transform them as necessary.

Model selection and training: We will then select a suitable machine learning algorithm for predicting house prices, such as linear regression or a decision tree, and train the model on the preprocessed data.

Model evaluation and fine-tuning: We will evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics, such as mean absolute error and mean squared error, and fine-tune the model as necessary to improve its accuracy.
